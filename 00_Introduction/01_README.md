# Structure Of The Book

Each numbered chapter adds a new layer to the kernel, expanding it's capabilities. It's not strictly necessary to read them in order, but it is encouraged as some later chapters may reference earlier ones. 

There are also a pair of special chapters at the end of the book: one containing a series of unrelated but useful topics (appendices), and one containing descriptions of various hardware devices you might want to support.

The appendices chapter is intended to be used a reference, and can be read at any time. The drivers chapter can also be read at any time, but implementing support for these devices should come after the memory management chapter (when a VMM has been implemented).
