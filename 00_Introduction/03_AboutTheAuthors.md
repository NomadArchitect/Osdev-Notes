## About The Authors

*Nerd and in free time programmer!! - I just love software development and everything is about computer, the lower level the better. My main job is software developer, as well as my main hobby (not the only one). I wanted to write my own kernel since i discovered programming. Even though it took years to understand how to do it. My first attempt in writing a kernel was DreamOS (32 bit kernel). My main programming language is C, although i used also Java, Python, Go, Assembly.* - Ivan.

*I'm a hobbyist programmer, and have been working on my operating system kernel since 2021, called northport. I've experimented with a few other projects in that time, namely a micro-kernel and a window manager. Before getting into osdev my programming interests were game engines and system utilities. My first programming project that I finished was a task manager clone in C#. These days C++ is my language of choice, I like the freedom the language offers, even if its the freedom to cause a triple fault.* - Dean.
