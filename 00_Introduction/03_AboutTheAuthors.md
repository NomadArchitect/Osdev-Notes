@dreamos82 Feel free to put something about yourself here :D

*I'm a hobbyist programmer, and have been working on my operating system kernel since 2021, called northport. I've experimented with a few other projects in that time, namely a micro-kernel and a window manager. Before getting into osdev my programming interests were game engines and system utilities. My first programming project that I finished was a task manager clone in C#. These days C++ is my language of choice, I like the freedom the language offers, even if its the freedom to cause a triple fault.* - Dean.
